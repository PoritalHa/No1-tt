This is a bug to crawling the information of multiple choice question bank including the problem and answer,you need the requests.py and bs4.py to run this procedure,also you need the MicrosoftWebDriver.exe to support.I attach the MicrosoftWebDriver.exe in the files but you need to install the requests.py and bs4.py to support the running of procedure.

Then you can get to know what is doing in this procedure,the "题库.txt" is the result of the procedure.There are something not good in this procedure.I will appreaciate it if you can give an advice to me.

If you know it,you can also use other webdriver.

At last, you should obey the liscence of the project, you can't use the username or password in it to do other things,it just for experiencing.It is best you can use your own acount.
